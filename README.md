# Basic
This repository contains Basic code I have written over the years.
Much of it from when I was a teenager.

Digger2A: is a digger clone I made as a teenager for GWBasic. Not the tidiest of code but playable
Sking: was originally from a book that I don't remember anymore, recreated some time ago from memory.
Ghostng: a re-written game that originally came from an Usborne programming book. This version for GWBasic.
Dodge: a simple text-based platform game for GWBasic. It's a remake of an old game I lost due to a bad floppy disk.
Chaos: a simple program that demonstrates chaos theory. 
Fractri: program that draws the Serpinski triangle.
